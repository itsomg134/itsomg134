def generate_recommendations(user_id):
    habit_matches = neo4j.run(habit_based_query, userId=user_id)
    competitors = neo4j.run(competitive_query, userId=user_id)
    social_connections = neo4j.run(social_query, userId=user_id)

    # Combine scores with weights
    recommendations = []
    for user in set(habit_matches + competitors + social_connections):
        score = (habit_matches.get(user, 0) * 0.5 +
                competitors.get(user, 0) * 0.3 +
                social_connections.get(user, 0) * 0.2)
        recommendations.append((user, score))

    return sorted(recommendations, key=lambda x: -x[1])
4. Anti-Spam & Quality Control
Fraud Prevention Constraints
cypher
// Prevent fake account recommendations
MATCH (u:User)
WHERE u.onboarding_date > date().subtract('7d')
  AND size((u)-[:COMPLETED]->()) < 3
SET u.recommendable = false
Diversity Enforcement
cypher
WITH [
  {strategy: "habits", weight: 0.5},
  {strategy: "challenges", weight: 0.3},
  {strategy: "social", weight: 0.2}
] AS strategies

UNWIND strategies AS s
CALL {
  WITH s
  MATCH (me:User {id: $userId})
  // Execute corresponding query per strategy
  RETURN s.strategy AS type, recommendations
}
RETURN type, recommendations
LIMIT 3 PER type // Ensure variety
5. Performance Optimization
Graph Projection for Recommendation Subgraphs

cypher
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'recommendation_graph',
  ['User', 'Habit'],
  {
    COMPLETED: {orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'},
    FRIENDS_WITH: {orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'}
  }
)

json
{
  "event": "leaderboard_update",
  "challenge_id": "abc123",
  "data": {
    "your_rank": 15,
    "top_5": [
      {"user": "Jane", "score": 4200, "avatar": "..."},
      {"user": "You", "score": 3800, "avatar": "..."}
    ],
    "team_progress": {
      "your_team": 65,
      "rival_team": 58 
    }
  }
}
Concurrency Control
javascript
// Redis Lua script for atomic updates
const updateLeaderboard = `
local key = KEYS[1]
local user = ARGV[1]
local increment = tonumber(ARGV[2])
local max_score = tonumber(ARGV[3])

local current = redis.call('ZSCORE', key, user)
if not current then current = 0 end

if (current + increment) <= max_score then
  return redis.call('ZINCRBY', key, increment, user)
else
  return -1
end
`;
